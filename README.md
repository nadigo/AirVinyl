# AirVinyl 

Vinyl to airplay - Stream vinyl from Raspberry Pi to any Airplay speakers.

An "always-on" Raspberry pi streamer that connects to a record player (pre-amp), detects sound, and stream directly to Airplay (v2) speaker/s.
It was built using sox and [RAOP-Player](https://github.com/philippe44/RAOP-Player) to prove the concept and now ready to move to a full standalone code base.

Work in Progress ...
